Functionality:

This code creates a simple distance-sensing system using two ultrasonic sensors and LEDs.
It continuously measures distances and activates the corresponding LEDs if objects are detected within a 50 cm range.

Key Parts:

Setup:
Defines pins for sensors and LEDs.
Sets pin modes for input and output.
Initializes serial communication (likely for debugging).
Loop:

Continuously performs the following actions:
Activates and measures distance for sensor 1.
Activates and measures distance for sensor 2.
Turns on LED 1 if distance1 is less than 50 cm.
Turns on LED 2 if distance2 is less than 50 cm.
Turns off both LEDs otherwise.
Code Structure:

Pin Definitions:

trigPin1, echoPin1: Pins for sensor 1.
trigPin2, echoPin2: Pins for sensor 2.
2, 3: Pins for LEDs.

Setup Function:
Configures pin modes (output for trigger pins, input for echo pins, output for LEDs).
Starts serial communication (optional).
Loop Function:

Continuously repeats the following steps:
Sensor 1:
Sends a trigger pulse to sensor 1.
Measures the echo pulse duration from sensor 1.
Calculates distance1 based on the duration.
Sensor 2:
Sends a trigger pulse to sensor 2.
Measures the echo pulse duration from sensor 2.
Calculates distance2 based on the duration.
LED Control:
Turns on LED 1 if distance1 is less than 50 cm.
Turns on LED 2 if distance2 is less than 50 cm.
Turns off both LEDs otherwise.
