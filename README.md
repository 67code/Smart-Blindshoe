# Smart Blind shoe
This project is all about a new IoT based Smart shoe system for the blind made with the help of an ultrasonic sensor paired to an Arduino UNO board. 
The Smart shoe design provides a long-term solution for the blind to walk on roads independently. 
The smart shoe will help the Blind person to reach his destination independently. 
It is built using IoT Technology in which the shoe will be embedded with various sensors, Microcontroller and buzzers. 
This project also involves the real time location tracking of the blind people

Herewith I have attached the block diagram of the overall setup :-
